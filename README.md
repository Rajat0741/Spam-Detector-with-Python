Spam Detector with Python

This repository provides a Python implementation to detect spam messages using machine learning. The main script, Spam_detection_fixed.py, demonstrates every step from data loading to prediction. The project is suitable for learning about text classification, natural language processing, and basic ML workflows.

Features

- Loads and processes SMS message data for spam detection
- Cleans and vectorizes message text using CountVectorizer
- Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
- Evaluates model accuracy and prints results
- Allows users to test custom messages

Requirements

Python 3.6 or higher  
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy  
Dataset: CSV file with SMS messages and labels (spam/ham)

Setup

Install dependencies:
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy

Download or prepare a dataset in CSV format with columns for "label" and "message".

Example rows:
label,message
ham,Hey, are we still meeting tomorrow?
spam,Youâ€™ve won a free prize! Click this link now

Place the dataset in the same folder as the script or adjust the file path in Spam_detection_fixed.py.

Running the Spam Detector

To train and test the model, run the script:
python Spam_detection_fixed.py

You will see output showing model accuracy, confusion matrix, and examples of predictions.

Example Output

Model accuracy: 98.5 percent
Confusion Matrix:
[[962 12]
 [15 141]]

Test examples:
Message: "Congratulations, you have won a lottery! Call now."
Prediction: spam

Message: "Can we reschedule our meeting?"
Prediction: ham

Custom Testing

You can modify the script to input your own message for prediction.  
Example code snippet:
message = ["Your free coupon is waiting. Reply now!"]
prediction = model.predict(vectorizer.transform(message))
print(prediction)
